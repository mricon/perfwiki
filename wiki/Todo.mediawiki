=== Perf tools ===

* Factorize the multidimensional sorting between perf report and annotate (will be used by perf trace)
* Implement a perf cmp (profile comparison between two perf.data) (DONE, its called 'perf diff')
* Implement a perf view (GUI)
* Enhance perf trace:
** Handle the cpu field
** Handle the timestamp
** Use the in-perf ip -> symbol resolving
** Use the in-perf pid -> cmdline resolving
** Implement multidimensional sorting by field name

* The feature tests performed only when a file that needs those tests, or at least only when some .c or .h file will be rebuilt

* Packages needed for the build should be checked before we start building object files, such as bison (bpetkov)
