== ANNOTATIONS ==

TODO: description & examples

The perf annotations is based on '''objdump''' tool from binutils package.

== BINUTILS RESTRICTIONS ==

Annotations are based on debuginfo, which on most (Fedora) distributions
come in separated *-debuginfo packages. Unfortunately '''objdump''' does not
connect binaries with its debuginfo counterparts.

The result is that for binaries with separated debuginfo you'll not
see annotations in '''perf'''.

== WORKAROUND ==

There's a following workaround, that merges debuginfo back to the
binary. Such binary will display proper annotations in perf.

The binary we want to annotate properly is '''ls'''.
* find out the debuginfo holder:
<pre>
$ rpm -ql coreutils-debuginfo | grep ls.debug
/usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/ls.debug
</pre>

* '''OPTIONAL''' if your distribution uses prelink, you need to undo it:
<pre>
$ cp /bin/ls .
$ prelink -u ls
</pre>

* create the '''ls-di''' binary with debuginfo merged:
<pre>
$ eu-unstrip -o ls-di ./ls /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/ls.debug
$ file ls-di
ls-di: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV) [SNIP] not stripped
</pre>

* clean the build-id cache, since the '''ls''' share same build-id with '''ls-di''':
<pre>
$ perf buildid-cache -r ls
# or more efectively:
$ rm -rf ~/.debug/
</pre>

* enjoy your annotations via:
<pre>
$ perf record ./ls-di [SNIP]
$ perf annotate [FUNC]
$ perf report
</pre>
