== Intel Itanium 2 Montecito processor PMU ==


=== Introduction ===

Intel defines the architected PMU in the 'Intel IA-64 Architecture Software Developer's Manual'. However the architected PMU is a bare bone version of what is actually implemented. It is noteworthy that the Itanium 2
PMU has not changed too much, so support of the whole familly does not require rewriting the tools for each member
of the familly. Therefore readers interrested in the capabilities of the Itanium PMU should go directly to the specific documentation of a processor's functionality.

The Itanium-1 (Merced) is obsolete, so there's two PMU implementations that are available: The McKinley class PMU (with 4 counters), and the Montecito class PMU (with 12 counters). The Montecito processor supports hardware threads
(hyperthreading), so the 4 architected counters allow monitoring of activity of the whole core or the hardware thread,
while the 8 new counters can only monitor thread activity.
