== <tt>perf:</tt> Linux profiling with performance counters ==

=== Introduction ===

This is the wiki page for the <tt>perf</tt> performance counters subsystem in Linux.
Performance counters are CPU hardware registers that 
count hardware events such 
as instructions executed, cache-misses suffered, or branches mispredicted. They form
a basis for profiling applications to trace dynamic control flow and identify hotspots. 
 
<tt>perf</tt> provides rich generalized abstractions over hardware specific
capabilities. Among others, it provides per task, per CPU and per-workload counters,
counter groups, and sampling capabilities on top of those.
The userspace <tt>perf tools</tt> present a simple to use interface with commands like

* <tt>[[Tutorial#Counting_with_perf_stat| perf stat</tt>]]: obtain event counts
* <tt>[[Tutorial#Sampling_with_perf_record | perf record</tt>]]: record events for later reporting
* <tt>[[Tutorial#Sample_analysis_with_perf_report | perf report</tt>]]: break down events by process, function, etc.
* <tt>[[Tutorial#Source_level_analysis_with_perf_annotate | perf annotate</tt>]]: annotate assembly or source code with event counts
* <tt>[[Tutorial#Live_analysis_with_perf_top | perf top</tt>]]: see live event count 

To learn more, see the examples in the <tt>[[Tutorial]]</tt>.
