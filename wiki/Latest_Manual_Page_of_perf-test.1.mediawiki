= SYNOPSIS =

<pre>perf test [&lt;options&gt;] [{list &lt;test-name-fragment&gt;|[&lt;test-name-fragments&gt;|&lt;test-numbers&gt;]}]</pre>
= DESCRIPTION =

This command does assorted sanity tests, initially through linked routines but also will look for a directory with more tests in the form of scripts.

To get a list of available tests use ''perf test list'', specifying a test name fragment will show all tests that have it.

To run just specific tests, inform test name fragments or the numbers obtained from ''perf test list''.
