Intel x86-64 PMU (Nehalem)
==========================

The x86-64 PMUs are specific to each underlying architecture. The
Netburst architecture of the Pentium-4 has given way to the Core
architecture, in use in Nehalem, i7 processors.

The recent PMUs seem to be somewhat structured similarly across Core and
Atom CPU models.

PMU overview
------------

The diagram of PMU registers shows the registers available depending on
which processor family you are using. You are offered at least 4
counters.

The Nehalem PMU supports a hardware bufering scheme to collect multiple
samples from the PMU. When a counter overflows, the CPU interrupts into
firmware, which in turn copies the counters into a PEBS buffer record.
The following graph shows the indirection levels and the content of each
record.
